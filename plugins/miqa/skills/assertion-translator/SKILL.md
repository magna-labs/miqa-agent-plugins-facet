description: Translate a Python analysis script or natural-language request into MIQA Output Explorer assertions and a coverage report. Use when a user asks for MIQA assertions, Output Explorer checks, a translation of analysis code or stated requirements into MIQA tests, test/check suggestions for one or two executions, or help designing what checks a Test Block should contain (this skill drafts the assertions content only — see the Publish gate for what it never creates).

# Assertion Translator

Create an assertions blob and `coverage.md`. Show the coverage report to the user before offering
to publish anything.

## Domain

Every use of this skill is bioinformatics test engineering — the output data type varies (VCF, BAM,
FASTQ QC, coverage/metrics TSVs, JSON annotation calls, pipeline logs), but the reviewer's question is
always some form of "did this pipeline rerun still produce correct, consistent output." Default to the
conventions a bioinformatics test engineer would reach for: natural genomic match keys (e.g.
`CHROM`/`POS`/`REF`/`ALT` for variant-shaped data, sample/read IDs elsewhere), QUAL/FILTER/coverage/
depth-aware tolerances instead of blanket equality, precision/recall/F1 framing for call-set
comparisons where the check family actually applies (see the vocab-blurb gating rule below), and log/
error-pattern scanning for pipeline health. These are defaults, not requirements: evidence (execution
files, columns) and the user's own stated desires both override them — the domain lens fills in what
the request hasn't already decided, it never overrides what the user actually asked for.

## Workflow

1. Require a Python analysis script or a natural-language request. Accept an optional
   column-mapping JSON, execution id, and sample input files. If the request names bare numeric
   IDs without saying which MIQA entity they are, ask whether they are Execution IDs or Test Chain
   Run IDs before resolving anything — Execution and Test Chain Run are separate ID spaces that can
   overlap numerically (especially for older data), so never infer the type from the number's range
   or from which tool happens to accept it. A Test Chain Run ID given for a check-design request
   still needs resolving down to its underlying execution(s) via `get_test_chain_run_environment`
   before calling `inspect_execution_outputs`. When exactly two Execution IDs are given together,
   always interpret them as one baseline/test comparison pair, never as two independent
   single-execution requests — take the first-named execution as baseline and the second as test
   unless the request states otherwise, and call `inspect_execution_outputs` on both before writing
   any check.
2. Resolve the MIQA guidance from `$MIQA_DOCS_BASE_URL/<path>`, using
   `references/doc-paths.md`. If `MIQA_DOCS_BASE_URL` is not set, call the MCP
   `get_documentation_url` tool and use its `docs_url` as the base in its place if it returns one.
   If that tool is unavailable or returns a null `docs_url`, ask the user to set
   `MIQA_DOCS_BASE_URL` and stop without writing a blob. Never translate the DSL from memory.
3. Call `get_output_explorer_vocabulary()` once and save its payload. Use it for the schema, enum
   values, starter blurbs, and global variable names. If the tool or a vocabulary section is
   unavailable, continue where possible and record the validation that cannot run. Never hardcode
   a documentation URL, share token, or global variable.
4. Read `references/patterns.md`. Before writing `_variables`, `_extends`, `_precompute`, `$name`,
   or `{{ name }}`, also read `references/variables-and-precompute.md`.
5. Normalize the source into reviewer questions, collect evidence, translate every question, and
   write both output files.
6. Validate the blob, show `coverage.md`, and wait for explicit approval before publishing.

## Interpret the source

For each check, identify the reviewer question, data scope, comparison mode, match keys,
computation, output form, explicit outcome, source evidence, and unconfirmed facts. Use this as a
working checklist, not as another artifact or schema.

With a Python script, derive the intent and source lines from its behavior. Keep the result
report-only: never write `relationship`, `static`, `threshold`, or `threshold_type`. If a reviewer
might gate on a stat, name it as a threshold candidate in the coverage report.

With a natural-language request, treat the user's statements as semantic evidence. Ask only when a
missing choice changes the check's meaning and execution or samples cannot resolve it. Examples
include an unclear comparison direction, match key, meaning of “match,” or pass condition. Do not
ask for facts that the available evidence can establish. Do not add a separate confirmation step
when the request is complete.

Treat requests to compare, show, report, or plot as report-only unless they state an outcome. Treat
conditions such as “no records are missing,” “values must be equal,” or “fail above 2%” as explicit
outcomes. Translate an explicit outcome with the live vocabulary and schema. Never invent a
column, match key, mapping, baseline direction, or threshold.

## Evidence rules

Use the strongest available source for each fact:

| Fact | Preferred source | Fallback | Without evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File keys and pattern | Execution | Observed or source-named basenames | Derive from the source and mark unconfirmed |
| Columns, delimiter, cast | Execution | Sample files | Mark columns unconfirmed, omit delimiter, and write a cast stub |
| Value mappings | Explicit supplied mapping | Sample files | Write a `map_values` stub and mark value encoding unconfirmed |
| Column rename | Mapping JSON or explicit request | None | Do not invent one |

For an execution, call `inspect_execution_outputs`. Use its file keys, delimiter, cast, and columns.
It reads partial content for at most 20 files and returns no values. Name excluded files in the
coverage report. Use sample files only for facts the execution cannot provide, such as value-level
encoding.

Treat file and column names in a natural-language request as intended names, not proof that they
exist in the data. Confirm them from execution or samples when available, otherwise mark them
unconfirmed.

Write a column mapping as one `rename` transform. Use renamed target columns in every `stat`,
`query`, and `chart_values` expression. Keep the original names only in the rename transform.

Derive `file_rules.pattern` from execution file keys when available. Name the matched files and
mark the pattern confirmed. Reject a pattern that matches no execution file. Without an execution,
derive the pattern from observed or source-named basenames, and mark it unconfirmed. Do not infer
MIQA path nesting from sample files.

Treat the vocabulary's starter blurbs (`get_output_explorer_vocabulary`'s `blurbs`) as a signal for
which check-type families are actually usable in this deployment, not just naming ideas. Result-based
types (`accuracy`, `concordance`, `overlap_count`, `result_field_check`) need Parsed Results
configured on the pipeline, and `postproc_*` types need a built-in postprocessor — both are
deployment-side facts this skill cannot otherwise check. If no blurb hints at either family, do not
research or use it, even when the request's own wording says "concordance," "accuracy," or similar —
treat that wording as intent and translate it onto the closest raw-file/tabular equivalent instead
(e.g. `paired_tabular_mdo_eval`/`tabular_mdo_eval`), noting the substitution in `coverage.md`.

The blurb's presence is itself the confirmation — when a blurb for the family exists, include the
check without looking for further proof. Do not let an unrelated failure (a different check, a
different pipeline, a past run's malformed report) override that signal into dropping the check —
that kind of history is a watch-item worth naming in `coverage.md`, not a reason to withhold the
check itself.

## Translation rules

Create one check per question that a reviewer asks about the outputs. Combine helper functions,
loops, and column operations when they answer one question.

Apply these MIQA rules even when the source has a different structure:

- Translate a comparison of two files into one `file_rules.pattern` that matches both files, with
  `"versions": [-1]`. Compare `data_baseline` with `data_test`.
- Translate a sequence comparison with a DSL comparator, such as
  `compare_by('<field>', 'alignment_ratio')`. Do not drop it.
- Translate a plot into `chart_config` with the live vocabulary's matching `chart_type`. Do not
  drop it.

For `compare_by`, `compare_fields`, or `compare_all_fields`, make `stat` Boolean. End the
comparison with `.summary().is_match_within_threshold`; do not return the comparison object,
`.results()`, or `.summary()` from `stat`. If detail, table, or chart expressions reuse the full
comparison, bind it once in `_precompute` and keep the Boolean expression in `stat`.

For any expression-based check (`tabular_mdo_eval`, `json_mdo_eval`, and their paired/postproc
variants, `execution_stats`, etc. — not the param-declarative types like `result_field_check`,
which already surface their raw value separately from `relationship`/`threshold`) whose `stat`
is a Boolean built by comparing a computed value against a threshold — e.g.
`data.rows.map('DP').mean >= 1000` — never leave the computed value only reachable inside the
Boolean. Bind it once in `_precompute` and set `detail_display_stat` to that same bound name, so
the report shows the actual number next to the pass/fail result instead of just true/false:

```json
{
  "_precompute": { "avg_dp": "data.rows.map('DP').mean" },
  "stat": "avg_dp >= 1000",
  "detail_display_stat": "avg_dp"
}
```

Apply this whenever the request states a threshold outcome (see below); a report-only stat with
no gate has nothing to add a `detail_display_stat` alongside, since the computed value is already
the whole `stat`.

A stated threshold outcome must actually gate — pick exactly one of two shapes, never a bare
computed `stat` with neither:

- **Declarative:** `stat` stays the raw computed value; `relationship`/`threshold`/
  `threshold_type` do the gating (matches the vocabulary's own blurbs, e.g. `"stat": "recall",
  "relationship": "lt", "threshold": 0.95`). No `detail_display_stat` needed — `stat` already is
  the number.
- **Boolean:** `stat` is the comparison itself, with `_precompute` + `detail_display_stat` as
  above so the number doesn't disappear behind true/false.

Verify which shape a given `check_type` actually uses empirically — via `api_run_adhoc_assertions`
against a known-bad execution when one exists, per `manual-repro-execution`'s step 7 — rather than
assuming pass/fail direction from another check type's docs or blurb; it is not guaranteed
consistent across check types (see `relationship`'s left-to-right meaning for `tabular_mdo_eval`
vs. `accuracy` in past experience). A bare computed `stat` with no `relationship`/`threshold` and
no Boolean is silently report-only forever — it never fails, no matter how bad the data is.

For a natural-language request, write outcome fields only when the request states a pass or fail
condition. Preserve its meaning without making the condition stricter or weaker. When no condition
is stated, write the computed result only.

Give every check a `description` field, in addition to `name`: one sentence stating the reviewer
question it answers.

When the source is a Jira (or other tracked-requirement) ticket, tag every check translated from
it with `external_id` set to that ticket's key (e.g. `"BTR-1"`) by default — do not ask first; it
only makes the check findable via `api_get_test_blocks_by_external_id`/
`api_list_test_block_external_ids` later, and is trivial to change. Ask only when the source names
more than one ticket and it is unclear which key applies to which check, or the request itself
says not to tag.

## Coverage report

Before marking a behavior `dropped`, check the analyzer and chart paths in
`references/doc-paths.md` and the mappings in `references/patterns.md`.

Use exactly this compact format:

```markdown
# Coverage

**Status:** `READY|NOT READY`

| Source | Output Explorer check | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<script line or request statement>` | `<reviewer question or check name>` | `translated|approximated|dropped` | `<material limit, or blank>` |

## Notes

- Evidence: files `<confirmed|unconfirmed>`; columns `<confirmed|unconfirmed>`; excluded `<files>`
- Gate: `<explicit condition|report-only>`; candidates `<stats>`
- Assumptions: `<stubs, unchecked mappings, or semantic assumptions>`
- Validation: `<PASS|SKIPPED: reason>`
```

Write one table row per source behavior or requested question. Use `READY` only when validation has
no `FAIL`, no semantic choice blocks translation, and any supplied execution confirms a matching
pattern. Use one line per note. Omit absent note parts and whole note lines instead of writing
`none`. Never add an introduction, conclusion, rationale section, or repeated explanation. Do not
omit a source behavior, material limit, threshold candidate, assumption, excluded file, or
`SKIPPED` result.

## Validation

Before running the schema validator, verify by eye that every top-level group key in the blob is
the exact `check_type` string shared by every check inside that group's `checks` array (see
`references/patterns.md`). The draft-07 schema's `patternProperties` accepts any group name, so a
`PASS` from the validator below is not evidence this is correct — it only catches this if you check
it yourself, every time, before treating a blob as ready.

Run via `uvx` from `miqatools` 2.x, which ships the `outputexplorer` module, with no local
`pip install`:

```
uvx --from 'miqatools>=2.0.0,<3' python -m miqatools.outputexplorer.validation BLOB.json --vocab VOCAB.json
```

If `uvx` is unavailable, fall back to a local `python -m miqatools.outputexplorer.validation` and
record `SKIPPED: <reason>` in the coverage report if neither path runs.

Require valid JSON, draft-07 schema conformance, live enum values, valid Jinja syntax, and references
that resolve against local variables or vocabulary global variables. The command does not validate
columns or semantic fidelity.

Fix every `FAIL` before calling the blob ready. Copy every `SKIPPED` finding into the coverage
report. Record column confirmation separately.

## Publish gate

Always write the blob and `coverage.md` after translation, even when the blob is not ready. Show
the coverage report before offering to publish.

Preview first:

```
publish_adhoc_assertions(assertions, name, description, execution_id=None, apply=False)
```

Use the script filename or a concise request-derived name. Include the source, date, and coverage
report in the description. Publish with `apply=True` only after explicit user approval. When asking
for that approval, describe it in plain terms the user actually asked for — a temporary, shareable
save that can be loaded in Output Explorer — not as "publishing" a formal record. Never expose tool
or parameter names (`apply=True`, "ad-hoc record", `publish_adhoc_assertions`) in that question. Say
plainly that this does not create or change a Test Block — it only saves this scratch link — and
that turning it into a real Test Block is a separate, later step if the user wants one. For example:
"Want me to save this so it's easy to share and load into Output Explorer? This won't create a Test
Block — it's just a shareable link. We can wire it into an actual Test Block afterward if you want
it to persist." If the tool is unavailable, tell the user to paste the blob into Output Explorer's
JSON tab.

`publish_adhoc_assertions` takes a single `execution_id` and returns a URL with one `exec_id` query
param — it has no baseline-execution input. When the user has shared (or the request otherwise
names) a specific baseline execution id alongside the test execution id, do not show that raw
returned URL as the final link. Instead replace its `exec_id=<test>` query param with
`exec_ids_baseline=<baseline>&exec_ids_test=<test>` before showing it to the user, so the link opens
pinned to the actual baseline/test pair rather than whatever "previous version" Miqa would otherwise
resolve automatically.

Never create or change a Test Block, Test Chain, or any MIQA resource other than this saved ad-hoc
record.
